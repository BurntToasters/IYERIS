  * Switch between tabs with Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab
  * Close tabs with Ctrl+W, open new tabs with Ctrl+T
  * Middle-click folders to open them in new tabs
* **Custom Theming:** Fixed an issue where the theme edior would be 'locked-out' if a user selects a custom theme.
* **Theme Section:** Decoupled the custom theme options and the baked-in native app themes.
  * *This change is experimental. I am not sure if I will keep it this way, or change the UI again for better UX.*

* **Feature:** Enhanced Quick Look preview support for video, audio, and PDF media types
* **Feature:** Recent Files section in sidebar - tracks recently opened files and persists across sessions
* **Feature:** Folder Statistics in Properties modal - shows file type breakdown with counts, sizes, and visual progress bars
* **UX:** Large folder warning toast for folders with 10,000+ items

* **Performance:** Added caching for settings (5s TTL), 7zip path, and file icons
* **Performance:** Debounced settings saves and search input to reduce disk writes and API calls
* **Performance:** File lookups now use O(1) hash maps instead of O(n) array searches
* **Performance:** Parallel initialization of platform detection (isMas, isFlatpak, isMsStore)
* **Performance:** Throttled archive operation progress rendering
* **Code Quality:** Enabled TypeScript strict mode for improved type safety and better error detection
* **Code Quality:** Improved type safety with strongly-typed UndoAction union types
