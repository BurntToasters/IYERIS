## What's New in `v0.9.0-beta.3`

### Theming
* **Custom Theming:** Fixed an issue where the theme edior would be 'locked-out' if a user selects a custom theme.
* **Theme Section:** Decoupled the custom theme options and the baked-in native app themes.
  * *This change is experimental. I am not sure if I will keep it this way, or change the UI again for better UX.*

### Codebase
* **Optimization:** Moved a large amount of startup functions to async operations/merged others together.
* **Optimization:** Enabled more ElectronJS flags to speed up app performance primarily on windows (but all platforms will see a performance increase).
* **Startup:** Fixed an issue where the UI would not be interactible for a few seconds once the app was launched.
* **Stabilization:** Revamped some legacy code modules to work better with the newer portions of the codebase.

## Changes in `v0.9.0`

* **Feature:** Advanced search filters (file type, size range, and date range)
* **Feature:** Enhanced Quick Look preview support for video, audio, and PDF media types
* **Feature:** Recent Files section in sidebar - tracks recently opened files and persists across sessions
* **Feature:** Folder Statistics in Properties modal - shows file type breakdown with counts, sizes, and visual progress bars
* **UX:** Large folder warning toast for folders with 10,000+ items
* **Performance:** Reduced backdrop blur values across the UI for better performance on lower-end hardware
* **Performance:** Added caching for settings (5s TTL), 7zip path, and file icons
* **Performance:** Debounced settings saves and search input to reduce disk writes and API calls
* **Performance:** File lookups now use O(1) hash maps instead of O(n) array searches
* **Performance:** Parallel initialization of platform detection (isMas, isFlatpak, isMsStore)
* **Performance:** Throttled archive operation progress rendering
* **Code Quality:** Enabled TypeScript strict mode for improved type safety and better error detection
* **Code Quality:** Improved type safety with strongly-typed UndoAction union types
* **Code Quality:** Extracted magic numbers into named constants

## Security Updates in `v0.9.0`

* **CSP:** Added Content Security Policy headers to prevent XSS and injection attacks
* **Archive Safety:** Added archive path traversal protection - archives containing `..` or absolute paths are now rejected
* **Process Safety:** Added spawn timeout protection to prevent runaway processes
* **Navigation Safety:** Blocked `window.open`, `will-navigate`, and `will-redirect` to prevent unauthorized navigation
* **Path Validation:** Added `isPathSafe` checks to all file operation IPC handlers
* **Command Injection:** Replaced `exec` with `execFile` for hidden file checking on Windows (prevents shell injection)

---

## Fixes in `v0.9.0`

* **MS STORE:** Fixed "Start on Login" for Microsoft Store version using Windows StartupTask API
* **Navigation:** Fixed history duplication when using back/forward buttons
* **Thumbnails:** Fixed thumbnail loading for files that are removed from the DOM before loading completes
* **Memory:** Disconnect thumbnail observer when navigating away to prevent memory leaks
* **Theme Editor:** Fixed issue where users couldn't re-open the theme editor after selecting a custom theme
* **Theme Editor:** Custom theme option now always displays as "Custom..." instead of changing to the theme name

## Open Issues:
* **MS STORE:** IYERIS doesn't open on login despite users turning on the setting to do so. [#26]
  * *Addressed in this release - testing ongoing*

### MSI Installer Support (MSI builds are NOT provided for betas)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Enterprise Users:** We now support Windows X64/ARM64 `.MSI` installers for MDM/AD deployment.
>
> * **.MSI installers do NOT support auto-updates.** You must deploy the new MSI manually.
> * These are strictly for enterprise management; standard users should use the **EXE** above.
> * *Files available in the "Assets" dropdown below.*

* **Code Signing:** MacOS releases are fully signed. Windows releases are not signed by an org, but are signed by my GPG signature (same with Linux).
