## 7-Zip

IYERIS bundles the 7za command-line executable from 7-Zip for archive compression and extraction. The 7za binary is distributed via the `7zip-bin` npm package (MIT-licensed wrapper), but the binary itself is a separate work by Igor Pavlov.

**License:** LGPL-2.1-or-later (GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later)

**License Text (summary):**
7-Zip is free software distributed under the GNU LGPL. You can use 7-Zip on any computer, including in commercial organizations. You don't need to register or pay for 7-Zip.

The unRAR restriction applies: you may not use the unRAR source code to create a RAR archiver or to re-create the RAR compression algorithm.
